# Introduction
[![View Image to cylindrical and spherical projection/warping on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/96962-image-to-cylindrical-and-spherical-projection-warping) [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=preethamam/Image2CylindricalSpherical)

Transforms the color or grayscale 2D image to the cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Fast as no for-loops are used.
